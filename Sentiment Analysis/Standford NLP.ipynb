    "Since StandfordCoreNLP is written in Java, we need to use pycorenlp (a python wrapper for StandfordCoreNLP) to connect to Java and use it here. To run the following codes, you need to install the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install latest StandfordCoreNLP version (a zip file) from http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-latest.zip \n",
    "    - Note: In MacOS, you can directly download by using wget or curl\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unzip the downloaded file, put it into a directory, say named `standford-corenlp-4.0.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Start the server using terminal\n",
    "    - Open the terminal, use `cd` to go to the directory you just created, type `cd Users\\xxx\\stanstandford-corenlp-4.0.0`\n",
    "    - Then type in `java -mx5g -cp \"*\" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -timeout 10000` \n",
    "    - Now you should see something like `[main] INFO CoreNLP - StanfordCoreNLPServer listening at /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000`, means that your server is started, waiting for data from port in 9000\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Then download the `pycorenlp` package using `pip install pycorenlp` \n",
    "5. Now you should be good to run the following sentiment anaylsis code using StandfordCoreNLP (note the port below is also using 9000 as you just set. If port name not consistent, your code would fail)\n"
